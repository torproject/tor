description of the patch.)

Backport for 0.2.0:
   o r17891: Fix a fun OpenBSD warning.
   o r17892: Fix another fun OpenBSD warning.
   o r17920: bridge relays don't fetch descriptors much

Backport for 0.2.0 once better tested:
  Xo r16621: Make some DNS code more robust (partial; see also libevent
            approach). (Also maybe r16674)
    [Partially backported.  Instead of the basic name checking, I backported
     r17171 instead, to be even more resistant to poisoning.]
  - r17208,r17209,r7211,r17212,r17214: Avoid gotterdammerung when an
    authority has an expired certificate.
  - r17886: Don't remove routerinfos as unlisted unless we have a
    consensus.
  - r17887: Don't accept 1.2.3 as a valid IP address.
  o r17917, r17993: tors that haven't run lately take 10+ minutes to start
  - r17924: Close streams when an exit hands us a local IP.

Backport for 0.2.0, maybe:
  d r17945: bridges always fail dirport reachability tests. i think
            it's cosmetic, so no need to backport.
