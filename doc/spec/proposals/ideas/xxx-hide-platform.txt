                      Hiding Tor Platform Information

0.0 Introduction

The current Tor program publishes its specific Tor version and related OS
platform information. This information could be misused by an attacker.

0.1 Current Implementation

Currently, the Tor binary sends data that looks like the following:

    Tor 0.2.0.26-rc (r14597) on Darwin Power Macintosh
    Tor 0.1.2.19 on Windows XP Service Pack 3 [workstation] {terminal services,
    single user}

1.0 Suggested changes

It would be useful to allow a user to configure the disclosure of such
information. Such a change would be an option in the torrc file like so:

    HidePlatform Yes

1.1 Suggested default behavior in the future

If a user would like to disclose this information, they could configure their
Tor to do so.

    HidePlatform No
