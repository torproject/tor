1. Directory compression.

  Gzip would be easier to work with than zlib; bzip2 would result in smaller
  data lengths.  [Concretely, we're looking at about 10-15% space savings at
  the expense of 3-5x longer compression time for using bzip2.]  Doing
  on-the-fly gzip requires zlib 1.2 or later; doing bzip2 requires bzlib.
  Pre-compressing status documents in multiple formats would force us to use
  more memory to hold them.
