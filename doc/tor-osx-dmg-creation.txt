## Instructions for building the official dmgs for OSX.
##

The following steps are the exact steps used to produce the "official"
OSX builds of tor.

Summary:
1) Compile and install a static version of the latest release of
libevent.
2) Acquire and install your preferred version of tor. Extract.
3) "make dist-osx"
4) You now have a dmg from which you can install Tor.

## Universal Binaries for OSX PPC and X86
## This method works in OSX 10.4 (Tiger) and newer OSX versions.
## See far below if you don't care about cross compiling for PPC and X86.
## The single architecture process starts with "###"

1) Install the latest XCode updates available from http://developer.apple.com.

## Compiling libevent

2)  Download latest stable libevent from
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

3) The first step of compiling libevent is to configure it as
follows:
CFLAGS="-O -g -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" \
./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --disable-dependency-tracking

4) Complete the "make" and "make install".  You will need to be root,
or sudo -s, to complete the "make install".

5) Check for a successful universal binary of libevent.a in, by default,
/usr/local/lib by using the following command:
	"file /usr/local/lib/libevent.a"

	Your output should be:
/usr/local/lib/libevent.a: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
/usr/local/lib/libevent.a (for architecture i386):      current ar archive random library
/usr/local/lib/libevent.a (for architecture ppc):       current ar archive

6) Get your preferred version of the tor source from https://www.torproject.org/download.  
Extract the tarball.

7) In the top level, this means /path/to/tor/, not tor/contrib/osx,
do a configure with these parameters:
CFLAGS="-O -g -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" \
CONFDIR=/Library/Tor \
./configure --prefix=/Library/Tor --bindir=/Library/Tor \
--sysconfdir=/Library --disable-dependency-tracking

8) "make dist-osx"

9) Confirm you have created a universal binary by issuing the follow command:
"file src/or/tor".  Its output should be as follows:
src/or/tor: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
src/or/tor (for architecture i386):     Mach-O executable i386
src/or/tor (for architecture ppc):      Mach-O executable ppc

10) There should exist in the top-level directory a
Tor-$VERSION-universal-Bundle.dmg

11) Congrats.  You have a universal binary. You are now ready to install Tor.

### Single Architecture Binaries for PPC or X86, not both.
### This method works in all versions of OSX 10.3 through 10.5

### Compiling libevent

1)  Download the latest stable libevent from
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

2) The first step of compiling libevent is to configure it as
follows:
       ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

3) Complete the "make" and "make install".  You will need to be root,
or sudo -s, to complete the "make install".

### Compiling Tor

4) Get your preferred version of the tor source from https://www.torproject.org.  Extract the
tarball.

5) In the top level, this means /path/to/tor/, not tor/contrib/osx,
do a configure with these parameters:
     CONFDIR=/Library/Tor ./configure --prefix=/Library/Tor \
     --bindir=/Library/Tor --sysconfdir=/Library

6) In same top level dir, do a "make dist-osx".  There now exists a
.dmg file in the same directory.  Install from this dmg.
