tor (0.1.2.1-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Forward port 07_log_to_file_by_default.dpatch.
  * Previously our defaults for DataDirectory, PidFile, RunAsDaemon, and
    Log differed from upstreams.  Now Tor behaves just like before (with
    our own DataDirectory and all) only when run as the debian-tor user.
    If invoked as any other user, Tor will behave just like the pristine
    upstream version.
  * Tell users about the init script when they try to run Tor as root.
    Should we also do this when they try to run their Tor as any other
    (non root, non debian-tor) user? - add 11_tor_as_root_more_helpful
  * Use tor --verify-config before start and reload.  Abort init script
    with exit 1 if config does not verify.
  * Change Standards-Version to 3.7.2.  No changes required.

tor (0.1.1.19-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Update debian/tor.docs file.

tor (0.1.1.18-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * update debian/tor.doc:
    - no longer ship INSTALL and README files, they are useless now.
    - doc/stylesheet.css, doc/tor-doc-server.html, doc/tor-doc-unix.html,
      doc/tor-hidden-service.html, doc/tor-switchproxy.html got replaced
      by doc/website/stylesheet.css and doc/website/tor-* which is more
      or less the same, only taken from the website.  Some links are
      probably broken still, but this should get fixed eventually.

tor (0.1.1.15-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Apparently passing --host to configure when not cross-compiling
    is evil now and greatly confuses configure.  So don't do it unless it
    actually differs from --build host.

  * Remove 08_add_newlines_between_serverdescriptors.dpatch.
  * Update 06_add_compile_time_defaults.dpatch
  * Use bin/bash for the init script instead of bin/sh.  We are using
    ulimit -n which is not POSIX  (closes: #338797).
  * Remove the EVENT_NOEPOLL block from etc/default/tor.
  * Add an ARGS block to etc/default/tor as suggested in #338425.

tor (0.1.0.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship debugging information in a separate package now, instead
    of simply not stripping tor.  This is still useful while tor is
    young.  Ideally it would go away some time.
  * Add LSB comments to init script as suggested by Petter Reinholdtsen
    on the debian-devel list:
    - http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01172.html
    - http://wiki.debian.net/?LSBInitScripts
  * Work around broken chroots that do not resolve localhost or resolve
    it to the wrong IP.  We now catch such cases in debian/rules, shout
    at the buildd maintainer, and ignore the result of our test suite.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 10:23:25 +0200

tor (0.1.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version - changes, among others:
    - Fixes the other half of the bug with crypto handshakes (CVE-2005-2643).
  * Since gs-gpl on s390 is broken (#321435) and unable to
    build PDFs of our images for the design paper this version
    ships them in the source and uses them on s390, should building
    them from source really fail.
  * Increase standards-version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2.  No changes
    necessary.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 23:55:05 +0200

tor (0.1.0.13-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version:
    - Explicitly set no-unaligned-access for sparc in configure.in.
      it turns out the new gcc's let you compile broken code, but
      that doesn't make it not-broken (closes: #320140).
    - Fix a critical bug in the security of our crypto handshakes.
      (Therefore set urgency to high).
    and more (see upstream changelog).
  * Slightly improve init script to give you proper error messages when
    you do not run it as root.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Aug 2005 01:27:49 +0200

tor (0.1.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version:
    - New IP for tor26 directory server,
    - fix a possible double-free in tor_gzip_uncompress,
    - and more (see upstream changelog).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jul 2005 17:36:24 +0200

tor (0.1.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version (closes: #316753):
    - Fixes a serious bug: servers now honor their exit policies -
      In 0.1.0.x only clients enforced them so far.  0.0.9.x is
      not affected.
  * Build depend on libevent-dev >= 1.1.
  * Urgency high because 0.0.9.10-1 did not make it into testing after
    like 3 weeks because of an impending ftp-master move.  So I might
    just as well upload this one.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jul 2005 17:53:48 +0200

tor (0.1.0.10-0.pre.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Forward port 03_tor_manpage_in_section_8.
  * Forward port 06_add_compile_time_defaults.
  * Add libevent-dev to build-depends.
  * Update URL to tor in debian/control and debian/copyright.
  * Add a snippet to disable epoll in etc/default/tor, commented out.
  * Add a snippet to set nice level in etc/default/tor.
  * Wait for 60 seconds in init stop.  35 is too little.
  * Don't depend on python anymore - tor-resolve is C now.
  * If "with-dmalloc" is in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS we build against libdmalloc4.
    Of course the -dev package needs to be installed.
  * Update README.Debian to say that upstream now does have a default
    for DataDirectory.
  * Don't fail in the init script when we cannot raise the ulimit.
    Instead just warn a bit (closes: #312882).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Jun 2005 16:38:06 +0200

tor (0.0.9.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * While we're waiting for a newer libevent to enter sid, make another
    upload of the 0.0.9.x tree:
    - Refuse relay cells that claim to have a length larger than the
      maximum allowed. This prevents a potential attack that could read
      arbitrary memory (e.g. keys) from an exit server's process
      (CVE-2005-2050).

tor (0.0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upstream used newer auto* tools, so hopefully the new config.sub
    and config.guess files (2003-08-18) are good enough to build
    tor on ppc64 (closes: #300376: FTBFS on ppc64).

tor (0.0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Set ulimit for file descriptors to 4096 in our init
    script.
  * Use SIGINT to shutdown tor.  That way - if you are a server -
    tor will stop accepting new connections immediately, and
    give existing connections a grace period of 30 seconds in
    which they might complete their task.  If you just run a
    client it should make no difference.

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (candidate).
    - cleans up more integer underflows that don't look exploitable.
      But one never knows (-> medium).
  * Remove those 'date' calls in debian/rules again that were
    added in rc5-1.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Dec 2004 11:11:23 +0100

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (candidate).
    - medium because it fixes an integer overflow that might
      be exploitable, but doesn't seem to be currently.
  * Add a few 'date' calls in debian/rules, so I can see how long
    building the docs take on autobuilders.

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9pre5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Symlink tor(8) manpage to torrc(5).
  * Make logs readable by the system administrators (group adm).
  * Point to /var/log/tor (the directory) instead of a single
    file (/var/log/tor/log) in the debian patch of the manpage.
  * Do not patch the default torrc to include settings we really want.
    Instead modify the compiled in default options.  Those settings are

    - RunAsDaemon is enabled by default.
    - PidFile is set to /var/run/tor/tor.pid.  No default upstream.
    - default logging goes to /var/log/tor/log instead of stdout.
    - DataDirectory is set to /var/lib/tor by default.  No default upstream.

    This is also documented in the new debian/README.Debian.
  * Remove /usr/bin/tor-control.py from the binary package, it is
    not really useful yet, and wasn't meant to be installed by
    default.
  * Change init startup script to properly deal with tor
    printing stuff on startup.

  * 04_fix_test can be backed out again.
  * Make sure all patches apply cleanly.
  * No longer use --pidfile, --logfile, and --runasdaemon
    command line options.  Set them in the configfile instead.
  * Change the description slightly, to say "don't rely on the current Tor
    network if you really need strong anonymity", instead of "Tor will not
    provide anonymity currently".
