matrix:
  ## Uncomment to allow the build to report success (with non-required
  ## sub-builds continuing to run) if all required sub-builds have
  ## succeeded.  This is somewhat buggy currently: it can cause
  ## duplicate notifications and prematurely report success if a
  ## single sub-build has succeeded.  See
  ## https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1696
  # fast_finish: true

  ## Uncomment the appropriate lines below to allow the build to
  ## report success even if some less-critical sub-builds fail and it
  ## seems likely to take a while for someone to fix it.  Currently
  ## Travis CI doesn't distinguish "all builds succeeded" from "some
  ## non-required sub-builds failed" except on the individual build's
  ## page, which makes it somewhat annoying to detect from the
  ## branches and build history pages.  See
