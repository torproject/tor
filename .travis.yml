  ## Uncomment to allow the build to report success (with non-required
  ## sub-builds continuing to run) if all required sub-builds have
  ## succeeded.  This is somewhat buggy currently: it can cause
  ## duplicate notifications and prematurely report success if a
  ## single sub-build has succeeded.  See

  ## Careful! We use global envs, which makes it hard to exclude or
  ## allow failures by env:

    ## gcc on OSX is less useful, because the default compiler is clang.
    - compiler: gcc
      os: osx
    ## gcc on Linux with no env is redundant, because all the custom builds use
    ## gcc on Linux

## We don't need sudo. (The "apt:" stanza after this allows us to not need
## sudo; otherwise, we would need it for getting dependencies.)

## But we use "sudo: required" to force non-containerized builds, working
## around a Travis CI environment issue: clang LeakAnalyzer fails
## because it requires ptrace and the containerized environment no
## longer allows ptrace.
