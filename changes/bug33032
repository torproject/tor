  o Minor bugfixes (key portability):
    - When reading PEM-encoded key data, tolerate CRLF line-endings even if
      we are not running on Windows. Previously, non-Windows hosts
      would reject these line-endings in certain positions, making
      certain key files hard to move from one host to another.
      Fixes bug 33032; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
