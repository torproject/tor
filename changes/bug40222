  o Major features (metrics):
    - Introduce a new class of extra-info statistics that allows relays to
      expose details of how overloaded they are. This information is controlled
      using the OverloadStatistics torrc option, and it will be used to make
      more informed decisions about the network's load balancing. Implements
      proposal 328; closes ticket 40222.
