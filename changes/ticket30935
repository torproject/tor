  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Numerous simplifications in configuration-handling logic:
      remove duplicated macro definitions, replace magical names
      with flags, and refactor "TestingTorNetwork" to use the
      same default-option logic as the rest of Tor.
      Closes ticket 30935.
