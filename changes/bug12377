  o Minor bugfixes (Linux, network interface):
    - On Linux systems, try to use an AF_NETLINK socket to determine the
      external interface's IP address, before falling back to the various
      older approaches (interface enumeration and then a UDP socket based
      hack). Fixes bug 12377; bugfix on 0.2.3.11-alpha.
