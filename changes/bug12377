  o Minor bugfixes:
    - On Linux systems try to use an AF_NETLINK socket to determine the
      external interface's IP address, before falling back to the various
      older approaches (interface enumeration and then a UDP socket based
      hack). Fixes part of #12377. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.3.11-alpha.
