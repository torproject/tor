  o Major bugfixes:

    - Fix a bug in the bounds-checking in the 32-bit curve25519-donna
      implementation that caused incorrect results on 32-bit
      implementations when certain malformed inputs were used along with
      a small class of private ntor keys. This bug does not currently
      appear to allow an attacker to learn private keys or impersonate a
      Tor server, but it could provide a means to distinguish 32-bit Tor
      implementations from 64-bit Tor implementations.
