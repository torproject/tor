  o Minor bugfixes (OS compatibility):
    - On Linux and Windows properly handle configuration change that
      moves a listener to/from wildcard IP address. In case first
      attempt to bind a socket fails, close the old listener and
      try binding a socket again. Fixes bug 17873; bugfix on
      0.0.8pre-1.
