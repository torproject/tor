  o Minor bugfixes (circuit padding negotiation):
    - Bump circuit padding protover so that clients won't try to negotiate
      circuit padding with 0.4.0 relays. Fixes bug 31356; bugfix on
      0.4.1.1-alpha.
  o Minor features (circuit padding logging):
    - Demote noisy client-side warn log to a protocol warning. Add additional
      log messages and circuit id fields to help with fixing bug 30992 and any
      other future issues.
