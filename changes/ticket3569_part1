  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Rework Tor SOCKS server code to use Trunnel and benefit from
      autogenerated functions for parsing and generating SOCKS wire
      format. New implementation is cleaner, more maintainable and
      should be less prone to heartbleed-style vulnerabilities.
      Implements a significant fraction of ticket 3569.
