  o Minor bugfixes (relays):
    - Check that both the ORPort and DirPort (if present) are reachable
      before publishing a relay descriptor. Otherwise, relays publish a
      descriptor with DirPort 0 when the DirPort reachability test takes
      longer than the ORPort reachability test.
      Fixes bug 18050; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
