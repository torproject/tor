  o Minor bugfixes (compilation, testing):
    - Correctly check for UBSan at configuration time, rather than using the
      ASan results. When activating the undefined behaviour sanitiser (UBSan),
      configure.ac was checking the address sanitiser (ASan) variables, instead
      of the UBSan variables. Fixes bug 29830; bugfix on 0.2.9.1-alpha.
