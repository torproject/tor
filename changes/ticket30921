  o Minor bugfixes (onion service v3):
    - When purging the client descriptor cache, always also close any
      introduction point circuits associated with it. This avoids picking those
      when connecting to them later while not having the descriptor to complete
      the introduction. Fixes bug 30921; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
