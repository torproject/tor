  o Major feature (hidden service v3):
    - Make HSDir stop using the descriptor revision counter. Instead, they now
      use a replaycache to keep track of which descriptor has been seen. If the
      descriptor is seen after the first upload, it is rejected. This is to
      avoid a replay attack which the revision counter where for originally.
      
      By removing the revision counter, it allows multiple services with the
      same onion address to be able to upload their descriptor and competing at
      the directory level (scalability use case). Before that, the service with
      the highest revision counter would always win meaning if one restarted
      more than the others, that one would win. Closes ticket 25552; bugfix on
      0.3.0.4-alpha.

  o Major feature (hidden service v3, client):
    - When decoding the v3 descriptor plaintext section, the revision counter is
      no longer mandatory. If not present, it is set to 0. However, services
      still put it in their descriptor for now.
