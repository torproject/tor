  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Use a full 256 bits of the SHA256 digest of a microdescriptor when
      computing which microdescriptors to download.  This keeps us from
      erroneous download behavior if two microdescriptor digests ever have
      the same first 160 bits. Fixes part of bug 13399; bugfix on
      0.2.3.1-alpha.
