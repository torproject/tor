  o Minor bugfixes (directory permissions):
    - When a user requests a group-readable DataDirectory, give it to
      them. Previously, when the DataDirectory and the CacheDirectory
      were the same, the default setting (0) for
      CacheDirectoryGroupReadable would always override the setting for
      DataDirectoryGroupReadable. Fixes bug 26913; bugfix on
      0.3.3.1-alpha.
