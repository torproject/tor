  o Major features (onion service)
    - Tor relays now support the HSDir version 3 protocol meaning they can
      store and serve v3 descriptors. This is part of the next generation
      onion service work detailled in proposal 224. The tor daemon also
      contains all the necessary code to encode and decode a v3 descriptor but
      it's currently only used by the directory subsystem. Closes #17238.
