  o Minor features (mainloop):
    - Move responsibility for
      flushing log callbacks
      from a once-per-second callback to a callback that is only scheduled as
      needed.  Once enough items are removed from our once-per-second
      callback, we can eliminate it entirely to conserve CPU when idle.
      Closes ticket
