  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Split sampled_guards_update_from_consensus() and
      select_entry_guard_for_circuit() into subfunctions.
      In entry_guards_update_primary() unite
      three smartlist enumerations into one and move smartlist
      comparison code out of the function. Closes ticket 21349.
