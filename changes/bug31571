  o Minor bugfixes (error handling):
    - Report the tor version whenever an assertion fails. Previously, we only
      reported the Tor version on some crashes, and some non-fatal assertions.
      Fixes bug 31571; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
    - On abort, try harder to flush the output buffers of log messages. On
      some platforms (macOS), log messages can be discarded when the process
      terminates. Fixes bug 31571; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
