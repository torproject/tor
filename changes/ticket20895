  o Minor features (forward-compatibility):
    - If a relay supports some link authentication protocol that we do not
      recognize, then include that relay's ed25519 key when telling other
      relays to extend to it.  Previously, we treated future versions as if
      they were too old to support ed25519 link authentication.
      Closes ticket 20895.
