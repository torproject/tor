  o Minor bugfixes (path counting):
    - When deciding whether we have any exit nodes, count the number listed
      in the consensus, not the number we have descriptors for. Fixes part
      of bug 14918; bugfix on 0.2.6.2-alpha.
    - Do not warn that we are missing directory information if we have
      decided not to fetch directory information due to a long period
      of idleness. Fixes part of bug 14918; bugfix on 0.2.6.2-alpha.
