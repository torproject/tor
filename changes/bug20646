  o Minor bugfix (util)
    - When finishing writing a file to disk, if we were about to replace the
      file with the temporary file created before and we fail to replace it,
      remove the temporary file so it doesn't stay on disk. Closes #20646;
      bugfix on tor-0.2.0.7-alpha; Patch by fk.
