  o Minor bugfixes:
    - When a command-line option such as --version or --help that
      ordinarily implies --hush appears on the command line along with
      --quiet, then actually obey --quiet. Previously, we obeyed --quiet
      only if it appeared later on the command line. Fixes bug 9578;
      bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
