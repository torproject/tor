  o Minor bugfixes (compatibility, standards compliance):
    - Fix a bug that would invoke undefined behavior on certain operating
      systems when trying to asprintf() a string exactly INT_MAX bytes
      long. We don't believe this is exploitable, but it's better
      to fix it anyway. Fixes bug 31001; bugfix on 0.2.2.11-alpha.
      Found and fixed by Tobias Stoeckmann.
