  o Removed features:
    - Remove client-side support for connecting to Tor servers running
      versions of Tor before 0.2.3.6-alpha. These servers didn't support
      the v3 TLS handshake protocol, and
      are no longer allowed on the Tor network.
      Implements the client side of ticket 11150.
