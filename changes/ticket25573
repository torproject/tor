  o Minor features (controller):
    - For purposes of CIRC_BW-based dropped cell detection, track half-closed
      stream ids, and allow their ENDs, SENDMEs, DATA and path bias check
      cells to arrive without counting it as dropped until either the END arrvies,
      or the windows are empty. Closes ticket 25573.
