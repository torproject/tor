  o Major features (onion service v3, denial of service):
    - Add onion service introduction denial of service defenses. They consist of
      rate limiting client introduction at the intro point using parameters that
      can be sent by the service within the ESTABLISH_INTRO cell. If the cell
      extension for this is not used, the intro point will honor the consensus
      parameters. Closes ticket 30924.
