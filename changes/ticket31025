  o Minor bugfixes (coverity):
    - In our siphash implementation, when building for coverity, use memcpy
      in place of a switch statement, so that coverity can tell we are not
      accessing out-of-bounds memory. Fixes bug 31025; bugfix on
      0.2.8.1-alpha.  This is tracked as CID 1447293 and 1447295.
