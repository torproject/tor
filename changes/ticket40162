  o Minor features (authorities):
    - Authorities now list the directory formats used by currently supported
      Tor releases as required.  Previously, they listed only the formats
      supported by older Tor releases as required.  This change makes
      the subprotocols "Cons=2 Desc=2 Microdesc=2" required, and makes
      "Cons=1 Desc=1 Microdesc=1" no longer required or recommended.
      Closes ticket 40162.
