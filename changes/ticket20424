  o Minor features (compilation):
    - Tor's configure script now supports a --with-malloc= option to select
      your malloc implementation. Supported options are "tcmalloc",
      "jemalloc", "openbsd", and "system" (the default). Addresses part of
      ticket 20424. Based on a patch from Alex Xu.
