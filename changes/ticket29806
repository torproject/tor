  o Minor features (bandwidth authority):
    - Make bandwidth authorities to ignore relays that are reported in the
      bandwidth file with the key-value "vote=0".
      This change allows to report the relays that were not measured due
      some failure and diagnose the reasons without the bandwidth being included in the
      bandwidth authorities vote.
      Closes ticket 29806.
