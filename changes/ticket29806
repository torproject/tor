  o Minor features (bandwidth authority):
    - Make bandwidth authorities to ignore relays that are reported in the
      bandwidth file with the key-value "vote=0".
      This change allows to report the relays that were not measured due
      some failure and diagnose the reasons without being included in the
      bandwidth authorities vote.
      Closes ticket 29806.
