  o Minor features (mainloop):
   - Move responsibility for
     keeping track of Tor's uptime
      from a nce-per-second callback to a callback that is only scheduled as
      needed.  Once enough items are removed from our once-per-second
      callback, we can eliminate it entirely to conserve CPU when idle.
      Closes ticket
