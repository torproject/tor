  o Minor bugfixes (v2 single onion services):
    - Always retry v2 single onion service intro and rend circuits with a
      3-hop path. Previously, v2 single onion services used a 3-hop path
      when rend circuits were retried after a remote or delayed failure,
      but a 1-hop path for immediate retries. Fixes bug 23818;
      bugfix on 0.2.9.3-alpha.
