  o Major bugfixes (onion service):
    - Report back HS circuit failure back into the HS subsytem so we take
      appropriate action with regards to the client introduction point failure
      cache. This improves reachability of onion services, since now clients
      notice failing introduction circuits properly. Fixes bug 32020; bugfix on
      0.3.2.1-alpha;
