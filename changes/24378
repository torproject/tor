  o Removed features:

    - Directory authorities will no longer support voting according to any
      consensus method before consensus method 25. This keeps authorities
      compatible with all authorities running 0.2.9.8 and later, and does
      not break any clients or relays. Implements ticket 24378 and
      proposal 290.
