  o Major feature (onion services):
    - Improve revision counter generation in next-gen onion services. Onion
      services can now scale by hosting multiple instances on different hosts
      without synchronization between them, which was previously impossible
      because descriptors would get rejected by HSDirs. Addresses ticket 25552.
