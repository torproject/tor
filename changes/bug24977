  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - Recompute some consensus information after clock skews or when we
      transition from a non-live consensus to a live consensus. We do this to
      avoid having an outdated state which could impact next-generation onion
      services. Fixes bug 24977; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
