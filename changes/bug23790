  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v2):
    - When reloading tor (HUP) configured with hidden service(s), some
      information weren't copy to the new service object. One problem with this
      was that tor would wait at least the RendPostPeriod time before uploading
      the descriptor if the reload happened before the descriptor needed to be
      published. Fixes bug 23790; bugfix on 0.2.1.9-alpha.
