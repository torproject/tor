  o Minor features (doxygen):
    - Our "make doxygen" target now respects --enable-fatal-warnings by
      default, and does not warn about items that are missing documentation.
      To warn about missing documentation, run configure with the
      "--enable-missing-doc-warnings" flag: doing suspends fatal warnings
      for doxygen. Closes ticket 32385.
