  o Minor bugfixes (relays, brudges, memory safety):
    - Stop advertising incorrect IPv6 ORPorts in relay and bridge descriptors,
      when the IPv6 port was configured as "auto". This may be a low-severity
      memory safety issue, because the published port number may be derived
      from uninitialised or out-of-bounds memory reads.
      Fixes bug 32588; bugfix on 0.2.3.9-alpha
