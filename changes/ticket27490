  o Minor features (ipv6):
    - If ClientPreferIPv6ORPort is set to auto and a relay is being chosen
      for an ORPort connection, we prefer IPv4 or IPv6 at random if we have
      both. Previously, we preferred to IPv4 if ClientPreferIPv6ORPort is
      auto except when we are using bridges. Also, we add another option
      ClientAutoIPv6ORPort which blindly chooses between IPv4 and IPv6.
      Closes ticket 27490. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
