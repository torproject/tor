  o Minor feature (configure, build system):
    - The standard __ANDROID__ macro is now used for platform detection.
    - --enable-android provides the standard, minimal build configuration
      for creating Tor binaries to run either as a shared library or a daemon.
      It enables PIC, disables system torrc, systemd, and all doc generation.
      This flag is not required to build for Android.
      Closes ticket 31882.
