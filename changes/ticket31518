  o Major features (proxy):
    - In addition to HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5, Tor can make all OR
      connections through the HAProxy server. A new torrc option was added to
      specify the address/port of the server: TCPProxy <protocol>
      <host>:<port>. Currently the only supported protocol in the option is
      haproxy.
