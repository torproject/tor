  o Minor bugfixes (logging, bug reporting):
    - When logging a bug, do not say "Future instances of this warning
      will be silenced" unless we are actually going to do
      so. Previously we would say this whenever a BUG() check failed in
      the code.  Fixes bug 33095; bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha.
