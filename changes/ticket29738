  o Minor features (recommended packages):
    - No longer include recommended packages in votes as detailed in proposal
      301. The RecommendedPackages torrc option is deprecated and will no
      longer have any effect. "package" lines will still be considered when
      computing consensuses for consensus methods that include them. Fixes
      ticket 29738.
