  o Minor bugfixes (TLS bug handling):
    - When encountering a bug in buf_read_freom_tls(), return a
      "MISC" error code rather than "WANTWRITE".  This change might
      help avoid some CPU-wasting loops if the bug is ever triggered.
      Bug reported by opara.    Fixes bug 32673; bugfix on 0.3.0.4-alpha.
