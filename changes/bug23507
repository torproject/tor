  o Minor bugfixes (v3 single onion services):
    - Make v3 single onion services fall back to a 3-hop intro, when there
      all intro points are unreachable via a 1-hop path. Previously, v3
      single onion services failed when all intro nodes were unreachable
      via a 1-hop path. Fixes bug 23507; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
