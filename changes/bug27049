  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - When circuits timeout, count other onion service circuits when
      determining if circuits are opened. This eliminates bogus
      "No circuits are opened. Relaxed timeout for circuit..." messages
      on clients that are performing only onion service activity. Fixes
      bug 27049; bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha.
