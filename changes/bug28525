  o Minor features (address selection):
    - Make Tor aware of the RFC 6598 (Carrier Grade NAT) IP range, which is the
      subnet 100.64.0.0/10. This is deployed by many ISPs as an alternative to
      RFC 1918 that does not break existing internal networks. Closes ticket
      28525. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
