  o Major bugfix (Relay bandwidth statistics):
    - When we close relayed circuits, report the data in the circuit queues
      as being written in our relay bandwidth stats. This mitigates guard
      discovery and other attacks that close circuits for the explicit purpose
      of noticing this discrepancy in statistics. Fixes bug 23512; bugfix
      on 0.0.8pre3.
