  o Major bugfix (Relay bandwidth statistics):
    - When we close circuits due to memory pressure, report the data in the
      circuit queues as actually being written in our relay bandwidth stats.
      This mitigates a guard discovery and other attacks that induce memory
      pressure for the explicit purpose of noticing this discrepancy in
      statistics. Fixes bug 23512; bugfix on 0.0.8pre3.
