  o Minor bugfixes (networking, IP addresses):
    - When parsing addreses via Tor's internal DNS lookup API, reject IPv4
      addresses in square brackets, and accept IPv6 addresses in square
      brackets. This change completes the work started in 23082, making
      address parsing consistent between tor's internal DNS lookup and address
      parsing APIs. Fixes bug 30721; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
    - When parsing addreses via Tor's internal address:port parsing and
      DNS lookup APIs, require IPv6 addresses with ports to have square
      brackets. But allow IPv6 addresses without ports, whether or not they
      have square brackets. Fixes bug 30721; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
