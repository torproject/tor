  o Minor features (best practices tracker):
    - Give a warning rather than an error when a practracker exception is
      violated by a small amount; add a --list-overbroad option to
      practracker that lists exceptions that are stricter than they need to
      be, and provide an environment variable for disabling
      practracker. Closes ticekt 30752.
