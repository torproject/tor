The scripts directory holds tools for use in building, generating, testing,
and maintaining the Tor source code.  It is mainly for use by developers.

Code maintenance scripts
------------------------

maint/checkLogs.pl -- Verify that Tor log statements are unique.

maint/checkOptionDocs.pl -- Make sure that Tor options are documented in the
manpage, and that the manpage only documents real Tor options.

maint/checkSpaces.pl -- Style checker for the Tor source code.  Mainly checks
whitespace.

maint/findMergedChanges.pl -- Find a set of changes/* files that have been
merged into an upstream version.

maint/format_changelog.py -- Flow the changelog into the proper format.

maint/redox.py -- Find places that should have DOCDOC comments to indicate a
need for doxygen comments, and put those comments there.

maint/updateVersions.pl -- Update the version number in the .nsi and windows
orconfig.h files.


Testing scripts
---------------

test/cov-blame -- Mash up the results of gcov with git blame.  Mainly useful
to find out who has been writing untested code.

test/cov-diff -- Compare two directories of gcov files to identify changed
lines without coverage.

test/coverage -- Generates a directory full of gcov files. You need to use
this script instead of calling gcov directly because of our confusingly named
object files.

test/scan-build.sh -- Example script for invoking clang's scan-build
static analysis tools.
