# Hi!
# I'm redox.py, the Tor redocumentation tool!
# I am a horrible hack!
# I read the output of doxygen from stderr, and add missing DOCDOC comments
#   to tell you where documentation should go!
# To use me, edit the stuff below...
#  ...and run 'make doxygen 2>doxygen.stderr' ...
#  ...and run ./scripts/maint/redox.py < doxygen.stderr !
# I'll make a bunch of new files by adding missing DOCDOC comments to your
#    source.  Those files will have names like ./src/common/util.c.newdoc.
# You will want to look over the changes by hand before checking them in.
#
# So, here's your workflow:
#
# 0. Make sure you're running a bourne shell for the redirects below.
# 1. make doxygen 1>doxygen.stdout 2>doxygen.stderr.
# 2. grep Warning doxygen.stderr | grep -v 'is not documented' | less
#      [This will tell you about all the bogus doxygen output you have]
# 3. python ./scripts/maint/redox.py <doxygen.stderr
#      [This will make lots of .newdoc files with DOCDOC comments for
#       whatever was missing documentation.]
# 4. Look over those .newdoc files, and see which docdoc comments you
#     want to merge into the main file.  If it's all good, just run
#     "mv fname.c.newdoc fname.c".  Otherwise, you'll need to merge
#     the parts you like by hand.

# Which files should we ignore warning from?  Mostly, these are external
# files that we've snarfed in from somebody else, whose C we do no intend
# to document for them.
