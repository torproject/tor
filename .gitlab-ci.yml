# It is primarily based on a set of scripts and configurations by
# Hans-Christoph Steiner.  It only copies parts of those scripts and
# configurations for now.  If you want a new piece of functionality
# (more debians, more fedoras, android support) then you shouldn't
# start from scratch: have a look at the original ticket, at
# https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/32193 !

#
# Having said that, if there is anything really stupid here, don't
# blame it on Hans-Christoph! Tor probably added it on their own.
