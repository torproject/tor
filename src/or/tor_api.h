/**
 * \file tor_api.h
 * \brief Public C API for the Tor network service.
 *
 * This interface is intended for use by programs that need to link Tor as
 * a library, and launch it in a separate thread.  If you have the ability
 * to run Tor as a separate executable, you should probably do that instead
 * of embedding it as a library.
 *
 * To use this API, first construct a tor_main_configuration_t object using
 * tor_main_configuration_new().  Then, you use one or more other function
 * calls (such as tor_main_configuration_set_command_line() to configure how
 * Tor should be run.  Finally, you pass the configuration object to
 * tor_run_main().
 *
 * At this point, tor_run_main() will block its thread to run a Tor daemon;
 * when the Tor daemon exits, it will return.  See notes on bugs and
 * limitations below.
 *
 * There is no other public C API to Tor: calling any C Tor function not
 * documented in this file is not guaranteed to be stable.

 * Run the tor process, as if from the command line.
 *
 * The command line arguments from tor_main_configuration_set_command_line()
 * are taken as if they had been passed to main().
 *
 * This function will not return until Tor is done running.  It returns zero
 * on success, and nonzero on failure.
 *
 * If you want to control when Tor exits, make sure to configure a control
 * socket. The OwningControllerFD option may be helpful there.
 *
 * BUG 23847: Sometimes, if you call tor_main a second time (after it has
 * returned), Tor may crash or behave strangely.  We have fixed all issues of
 * this type that we could find, but more may remain.
 *
 * LIMITATION: You cannot run more than one instance of Tor in the same
 * process at the same time. Concurrent calls will cause undefined behavior.
 * We do not currently have plans to change this.
 *
 * LIMITATION: While we will try to fix any problems found here, you
 * should be aware that Tor was originally written to run as its own
 * process, and that the functionality of this file was added later.  If
 * you find any bugs or strange behavior, please report them, and we'll
 * try to straighten them out.
