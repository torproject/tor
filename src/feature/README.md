@brief feature: domain-specific modules

The "feature" directory has modules that Tor uses only for a particular
role or service, such as maintaining/using an onion service, operating as a
relay or a client, or being a directory authority.

Current subdirectories are:

 - **\refdir{feature/api}** -- Support for making Tor embeddable
 - **\refdir{feature/client}** -- Functionality which only Tor clients need
 - **\refdir{feature/control}** -- Controller implementation
 - **\refdir{feature/dirauth}** -- Directory authority
 - **\refdir{feature/dircache}** -- Directory cache
 - **\refdir{feature/dirclient}** -- Directory client
 - **\refdir{feature/dircommon}** -- Shared code between the other directory modules
 - **\refdir{feature/dirparse}** -- Directory parsing code.
 - **\refdir{feature/hibernate}** -- Hibernating when Tor is out of bandwidth
or shutting down
 - **\refdir{feature/hs}** -- v3 onion service implementation
 - **\refdir{feature/hs_common}** -- shared code between both onion service
implementations
 - **\refdir{feature/keymgt}** -- shared code for key management between
relays and onion services. 
 - **\refdir{feature/nodelist}** -- storing and accessing the list of relays on
the network. 
 - **\refdir{feature/relay}** -- code that only relay servers and exit servers
need.
 - \refdir{feature/rend}** -- v2 onion service implementation
 - **\refdir{feature/stats}** -- statistics and history
