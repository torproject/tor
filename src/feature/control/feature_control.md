@brief feature/control: Controller API.

The Controller API is a text-based protocol that another program (or another
thread, if you're running Tor in-process) can use to configure and control
Tor while it is running.  The current protocol is documented in
[control-spec.txt](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/control-spec.txt).
