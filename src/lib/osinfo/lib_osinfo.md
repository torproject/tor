@brief lib/osinfo: For inspecting the OS version and capabilities.

In general, we use this module when we're telling the user what operating
system they are running.  We shouldn't make decisions based on the output of
these checks: instead, we should have more specific checks, either at compile
time or run time, based on the observed system behavior.
