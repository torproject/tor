 * A subsystem is a part of Tor that is initialized, shut down, configured,
 * and connected to other parts of Tor.
 *
 * All callbacks are optional -- if a callback is set to NULL, the subsystem
 * manager will treat it as a no-op.
 *
 * You should use c99 named-field initializers with this structure, for
 * readability and safety. (There are a lot of functions here, all of them
 * optional, and many of them with similar signatures.)
 *
 * See @ref initialization for more information about initialization and
 * shutdown in Tor.
 *
 * To make a new subsystem, you declare a const instance of this type, and
 * include it on the list in subsystem_list.c.  The code that manages these
 * subsystems is in subsysmgr.c.
