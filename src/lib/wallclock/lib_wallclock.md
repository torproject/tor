@dir /lib/wallclock
@brief lib/wallclock: Inspect and manipulate the current time.

This module handles our concept of "what time is it" or "what time does the
world agree it is?"  Generally, if you want something derived from UTC, this
is the module for you.

For versions of the time that are more local, more monotonic, or more
accurate, see \refdir{lib/time}.  For parsing and encoding times and dates,
see \refdir{lib/encoding}.
