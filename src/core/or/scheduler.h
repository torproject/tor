 * that returns a complete scheduler_t for your foo scheduler. See
 * scheduler_kist.c for an example.
 *
 * These function pointers SHOULD NOT be used anywhere outside of the
 * scheduling source files. The rest of Tor should communicate with the
 * scheduling system through the functions near the bottom of this file, and
 * those functions will call into the current scheduler implementation as
 * necessary.
 *
 * If your scheduler doesn't need to implement something (for example: it
 * doesn't create any state for itself, thus it has nothing to free when Tor
 * is shutting down), then set that function pointer to NULL.
